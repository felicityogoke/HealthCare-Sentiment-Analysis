# HealthCare-Sentiment-Analysis

The following libraries were used in this study:

- numpy - It is a library used for numerical computing in Python. It is particularly useful for handling large arrays and matrices.

- pandas - It is a library used for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It
provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are very useful
for handling tabular data.

- tensorflow - It is an open-source library used for machine learning and deep
learning. It provides a range of tools and resources for building and training
machine learning models.

- matplotlib - It is a plotting library used for creating visualizations in Python.
It provides a range of tools for creating 2D and 3D plots.

- seaborn - A data visualization library built on top of matplotlib. It provides a
range of high-level interfaces for creating attractive and informative statistical
graphics.

- tqdm - It is a progress bar library used for tracking the progress of longrunning
processes. It was used to display progress bars during training.

- sklearn - A machine learning library built on top of numpy and scipy. It provides
a range of tools for classification, regression, and clustering. It was
used for model selection and preprocessing.

 - keras - A high-level neural networks API written in Python. It is built on top
of TensorFlow and provides a range of tools for building and training deep
learning models. In the code, it was used for building the neural network
models.

- plotly - An interactive visualization library used for creating attractive and
informative web-based visualizations. In the code, it was used for creating
visualizations.

- LabelEncoder - A utility class provided by sklearn for encoding labels with
a value between 0 and n_classes-1. In the code, it was used to encode
categorical labels.
- accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score - These are functions provided by sklearn for evaluating the performance of
machine learning models. In the code, they were used to evaluate the performance
of the models.

The dataset consists of publicly available patient feedback data on various medications. This dataset will include patient ratings on specific medications, information on associated health conditions, and a rating system of range[1-5] reflecting overall patient satisfaction. Data collection involves extracting information from relevant online platforms and compiling it into a structured dataset suitable for analysis. It consists of 362806 rows and 12 columns
